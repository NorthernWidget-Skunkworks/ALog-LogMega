ALog-LogMega
============

Arduino Mega (ATmega 2560) version of the ALog, designed to accomodate a larger numbers of sensors, break out a more significant set of 3.3V I/O pins, include switched VCC output, include headers for Arduino shields with switched power (e.g., for telemetry), break out SPI, I2C, and UART for communications with a wider range of sensors (and more reliable UART communications than the Software Serial library), and handle a much larger code base
